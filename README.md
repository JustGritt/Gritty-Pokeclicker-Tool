[Gritty-Pokeclicker-Tool](#gpt) is a simple and customizable open-source autoclicker that focuses on performing repetitive tasks in clicker games ([Pokeclicker](https://www.pokeclicker.com/) in this case). Note that I created this tool to test the pyautogui and keyboard libraries, so there is room for improvement.
